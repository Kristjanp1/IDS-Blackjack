<h2>What code does</h2>
<p>The code reads in the dataset of blackjack played hands which we got from the kaggle, then it categorizes the hands, analyzes and makes optimal strategy from the hands and makes a three different tables from it (Hard-hand, soft-hand and pair table). Then there is a algorithm which basically plays blackjack with calculated tables against the dealer and finds if the find strategy is total bust or works more or less.</p>

<h2>How to run the code:</h2>
<p>To run the code, you need to run all the code blocks from the beginning to the end. The beginning is the block where we read in the data and the end is where we calculate our initial dataset and the generated dataset winrate, loserate and drawrate.</p>
